description: Designing a frame to lift max weight
technologies: Statics
---

Problem statement: Given a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length (your choice), 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator (pick from this online catalog, use max force values only), design a
frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height.
Assume all the supports and bar/actuator are rigid.

Below you can find my calculations for the task of creating a frame that can lift the max load. I decided on using the Integrated Servo Actuator because of it was small enough to fit into the build space but the max power output compared to the others.

Here you can see that a maximum weight of 50.9 kN.
