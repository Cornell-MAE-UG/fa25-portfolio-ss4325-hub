For my project, I decided to analyise a direct dry steam approarch used in producing geothermal energy in California. Below you can see a drawing of the system with the main components being a turbine and a generator.

Water from deep in the earth is pressurized and pumped to the surface as a saturated vapor and spins a turbine. It then condenses and turns into a liquid that is released back into the earth.
