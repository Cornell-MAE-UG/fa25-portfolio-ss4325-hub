This project analyzes a direct dry steam geothermal power plant, used at the Geysers geothermal field in California. In this system, naturally occurring steam from a geothermal reservoir is routed directly to a turbine to generate electricity.

### Overview

Water at high temperature and pressure is extracted from deep underground geothermal reservoirs through production wells. It is then run through a seperator that only allows the steam to pass through and the heavier liquid behind. Because the steam is seperated as  saturated vapor or superheated steam, it can be sent directly to a steam turbine. The steam expands through the turbine, producing shaft work that drives an electric generator.

After expansion, the low-pressure steam enters a condenser, which is not shown on the simplified diagram. It is cooled and condensed into liquid water using ambient cooling (through cooling towers). The condensed water is then reinjected into the geothermal reservoir for environmental and economical reasons.

This is an open system operating continuously, with both mass and energy crossing the system boundary.

Below you can see the full schematic of the cycle modeled as a control volume. The blue dashed lines signifies the system boundary and the red shows all of the W and Q input and outputs.
