For this project, we are developing a **passive, pre-harvest trap** to help **New York State industrial vineyards** keep harvested grapes clear of **spotted lanternflies (SLFs)** while minimizing additional labor.

---

## Problem Statement

New York State farmers are trying to keep harvested grapes clear of spotted lanternflies (SLFs) in industrial vineyards, but they lack the human labor. Since a large amount of grapes are machine-harvested as **juice/must**, it is hard to remove SLFs post-harvest without **yield loss** or **contamination**. Hence, we choose to **lure and capture SLFs pre-harvest** with a **modular trap design**.

---

## Impact

Passively removing SLFs:

- lowers the **labor burden** on vineyard operators,
- protects **grape quality** by limiting SLFs’ access to vines,
- reduces **reproduction**, compounding benefits over the season.

---

## Proposed Direction

### Primary Concept: 60 Hz + Methyl Salicylate Trap

A single station that uses **two attraction cues** and a **contained capture mechanism**.

**What it is:**  
A modular trap combining a battery-powered **60 Hz tone** and **methyl salicylate diffusion** to attract SLFs into a **sealed chamber** with **replaceable sticky panels**.

---

## How It Would Be Used

- Mount at **canopy height** near edges/hotspots  
- Run the **chemical dispersion** and **oscillations** during peak activity  
- Swap the **lure container** on schedule  
- Replace **sticky panels** when full and redeploy as hotspots shift  

---

## Why It’s Better Than the Status Quo

It attempts to:

- reduce **manual labor**,  
- prevent product contamination by acting **pre-harvest**,  
- minimize environmental disruption by acting **locally**.

---

## End-of-Semester Proof-of-Concept

We will **3D-print an enclosure** integrating:

- (1) **tone generator**,  
- (2) **lure diffuser**,  
- (3) **sealed capture volume** with quick-swap panels and an access lid.

Field testing may be limited by SLF availability, but **subsystem function and performance will be tested**.

---

## Key Risks / Unknowns

- **Dose** — Decide practical methyl salicylate concentration and expected capture rates via research & benchmarking.  
- **Weather** — Wind/rain may threaten device performance; bench-test weather-resilience.  
- **Coverage** — Determine trap arrangement; compare geometric distributions and choose the most efficient.

## Questions for the Client

1. **Will non-target insects be attracted by methyl salicylate in NYS vineyards?**  
   *Decision affected:* If so, we may need to remove the methyl salicylate module.

2. **What SLF reduction is economically meaningful for industrial vineyards?**  
   *Decision affected:* The required minimum density and cost of traps to maintain and manufacture.

3. **Are industrial vineyards in NYS equipped with chemical disposal facilities?**  
   *Decision affected:* We may need to reconsider disposal and trap materials.
